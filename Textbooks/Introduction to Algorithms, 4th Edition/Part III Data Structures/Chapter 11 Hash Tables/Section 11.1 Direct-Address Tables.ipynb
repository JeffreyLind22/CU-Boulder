    "Direct addressing is a simple technique that works well when the universe $U$ of keys is reasonably small. Suppose that an application needs a dynamic set in which each element has a distinct key drawn from the universe $U = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, m - 1\\}$, where $m$ is not too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the dynamic set, you can use an array, or **direct-address table**, denoted by $T[0 : m - 1]$, in which each position, or **slot**, corresponds to a key in the universe $U$. Figure 11.1 illustrates this approach. Slot $k$ points to an element in the set with key $k$. If the set contains no element with key $k$, then $T[k] = \\texttt{nil}$.\n",

    "The dictionary operations $\\texttt{Direct-Address-Search}$, $\\texttt{Direct-Address-Insert}$, and $\\texttt{Direct-Address-Delete}$ are trivial to implement. Each takes only O(1) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Direct-Address-Search(T, k)\n",
    "[1] return T[k]\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct-Address-Insert(T, x)\n",
    "[1] T[x.key] = x\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct-Address-Delete(T, x)\n",
    "[1] T[x.key] = nil\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For some applications, the direct-address table itself can hold the elements in the dynamic set. That is, rather than storing an element's key and satellite data in an object external to the direct-address table, with a pointer from a slot in the table to the object, save space by storing the object directly in the slot. To indicate an empty slot, use a special key. Then again, why store the key of the object at all? The index of the object *is* its key! Of course, then you'd need some way to tell whether the slots are empty."
