    "The search tree data structure supports each of the following dynamic-set operations: $\\texttt{Search}$, $\\texttt{Minimum}$, $\\texttt{Maximum}$, $\\texttt{Predecessor}$, $\\texttt{Successor}$, $\\texttt{Insert}$, and $\\texttt{Delete}$. Thus, a search tree can be used as both a dictionary and a priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic operations on a binary search tree take time proportional to the height of the tree. For a complete binary tree with $n$ nodes, such operations run in $\\Theta(\\lg{n})$ worst-case time. If the tree is a linear chain of $n$ nodes, however, the same operations take $\\Theta(n)$ worst-case time. In Chapter 13, we'll see a variation of binary search trees, red-black trees, whose operations guarantee a height of $O(\\lg{n})$. We won't prove it here, but if you build a binary search tree on a random set of $n$ keys, its expected height is $O(\\lg{n})$ even if you don't try to limit its height.\n",

    "After presenting the basic properties of binary search trees, the following sections show how to walk a binary search tree to print its values in sorted order, how to search for a value in a binary search tree, how to find the minimum or maximum element, how to find the predecessor or successor of an element, and how to insert into or delete from a binary search tree."
