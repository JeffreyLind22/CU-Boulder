    "The $i$th ***order statistic*** of a set of $n$ elements is the $i$th smallest element. For example, the ***minimum*** of a set of elements is the first order statistic ($i = 1$), and the ***maximum*** of a set of elements is the $n$th order statistic ($i = n$). A ***median***, informally, is the \"halfway point\" of the set. When $n$ is odd, the median is unique, occurring at $i = \\frac{n + 1}{2}$. When $n$ is even, there are two medians, the ***lower median*** occurring at $i = \\frac{n}{2}$ and the ***upper median*** occurring at $i = \\frac{n}{2} + 1$. Thus, regardless of the parity of $n$, medians occur at $i = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n + 1}{2} \\right\\rfloor$ and $i = \\left\\lceil \\frac{n + 1}{2} \\right\\rceil$. For simplicity in this text, however, we consistently use the phrase \"the median\" to refer to the lower median.\n",

    "This chapter addresses the problem of selecting the $i$th order statistic from a set of $n$ distinct numbers. We assume for convenience that the set contains distinct numbers, although virtually everything we do extends to the situation in which a set contains repeated values. We formally specify the ***selection problem*** as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** A set of $n$ distinct numbers and an integer $i$, with $1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** The element $x \\in A$ that is larger than exactly $i - 1$ other elements in $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve the selection problem in $O(n\\lg{n})$ time simply by sorting the numbers using heapsort or merge sort and then outputting the $i$th element in the sorted array. This chapter presents asymptotically faster algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 9.1 examines the problem of selecting the minimum and maximum of a set of elements. More interesting is the general selection problem, which we investigate in the subsequent two sections. Section 9.2 analyzes a practical randomized algorithm that achieves an $O(n)$ expected running time, assuming distinct elements. Section 9.3 contains an algorithm of more theoretical interest that achieves the $O(n)$ running time in the worst case."
