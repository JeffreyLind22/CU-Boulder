    "We saw in Section 7.2 that a worst-case split at every level of recursion of quicksort produces a $\\Theta\\left(n^2\\right)$ running time, which, intuitively, is the worst-case running time of the algorithm. We now proved this assertion.\n",

Because the procedure $\\texttt{Partition}$ produces two subproblems with total size $n - 1$, we obtain the recurrence\n",

    "## 7.4.2 Expected Running Time\n",
    "We have already seen the intuition behind why the expected running time of $\\texttt{Randomized-Quicksort}$ is $O(n\\lg{n})$: if, in each level of recursion, the split induced by $\\texttt{Randomized-Partition}$ puts any constant fraction of the elements on one side of the partition, then the recursion tree has depth $\\Theta(\\lg{n})$ and $O(n)$ work is performed at each level. Even if we add a few new levels with the most unbalanced split possible between these levels, the total time remains $O(n\\lg{n})$. We can analyze the expected running time of $\\texttt{Randomized-Quicksort}$ precisely by first understanding how the partitioning procedure operates and then using this understanding to derive an $O(n\\lg{n})$ bound on the expected running time. This upper bound on the expected running time, combined with the $\\Theta(n\\lg{n})$ best-case bound we saw in Section 7.2, yields a $\\Theta(n\\lg{n})$ expected running time. We assume throughout that the values of the elements being sorted are distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Time and Comparisons\n",
    "The $\\texttt{Quicksort}$ and $\\texttt{Randomized-Quicksort}$ procedures differ only in how they select pivot elements. They are the same in all other aspects. We can therefore analyze $\\texttt{Randomized-Quicksort}$ by considering the $\\texttt{Quicksort}$ and $\\texttt{Partition}$ procedures, but with the assumption that pivot elements are selected randomly from the subarray passed to $\\texttt{Randomized-Partition}$. Let's start by relating the asymptotic running time of $\\texttt{Quicksort}$ to the number of times elements are compared (all in line 4 of $\\texttt{Partition}$), understanding that this analysis also applies to $\\texttt{Randomized-Quicksort}$. Note that we are counting the number of times that *array elements* are compared, not the comparison of indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Lemma 7.1*\n",
    "The running time of $\\texttt{Quicksort}$ on an $n$-element array is $O(n + X)$, where $X$ is the number of element comparisons performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Proof*** The running time of $\\texttt{Quicksort}$ is dominated by the time spent in the $\\texttt{Partition}$ procedure. Each time $\\texttt{Partition}$ is called it selects a pivot element, which is never included in any future recursive calls to $\\texttt{Quicksort}$ or $\\texttt{Partition}$. Thus, there can be at most $n$ calls to $\\texttt{Partition}$ over the entire execution of the quicksort algorithm. Each time $\\texttt{Quicksort}$ calls $\\texttt{Partition}$, it also recursively calls itself twice, so there are at most $2n$ calls to the $\\texttt{Quicksort}$ procedure itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "One call to $\\texttt{Partition}$ takes $O(1)$ time plus an amount of time that is proportional to the number of iterations of the **for** loop in lines $3$-$6$. Each iteration of this **for** loop performs one comparison in line 4, comparing the pivot element to another element of the array $A$. Therefore, the total time spent in the **for** loop across all executions is proportional to $X$. Since there are at most $n$ calls to $\\texttt{Partition}$ and the time spent outside the **for** loop is $O(1)$ for each call, the total time spent in $\\texttt{Partition}$ outside of the **for** loop is $O(n)$. Thus, the total time for quicksort is $O(n + X)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: right\"> $\\blacksquare$ </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for analyzing $\\texttt{Randomized-Quicksort}$, therefore, is to compute the expected value $E[X]$ of the random variable $X$ denoting the total number of comparisons performed in all calls to $\\texttt{Partition}$. To do so, we must understand when the quicksort algorithm compares two elements of the array and when it does not. For ease of analysis, let's index the elements of the array $A$ by their position in the sorted output, rather than their position in the input. That is, although the elements in $A$ may start out in any order, we'll refer to them by $z_1, z_2, \\ldots, z_n$, where $z_1 < z_2 < \\cdots < z_n$, with strict inequality because we assume that all elements are distinct. We denote the set $\\{z_i, z_{i + 1}, \\ldots, z_j\\}$ by $Z_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next lemma characterizes when two elements are compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Lemma 7.2*\n",
    "During the execution of $\\texttt{Randomized-Quicksort}$ on an array of $n$ distinct elements $z_1 < z_2 < \\cdots < z_n$, an element $z_i$ is compared with an element $z_j$, where $i < j$, if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any other element in the set $Z_{ij}$. Moreover, no two elements are ever compared twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Proof*** Let's look at the first time that an element $x \\in Z_{ij}$ is chosen as a pivot during the execution of the algorithm. There are three cases to consider. If $x$ is neither $z_j$ nor $z_j$ - that is, $z_i < x < z_j$ - then $z_i$ and $z_j$ are not compared at any subsequent time, because they fall into different sides of the partition around $x$. If $x = z_i$, then $\\texttt{Partition}$ compares $z_i$ with every other item in $Z_{ij}$. Similarly, if $x = z_j$, then $\\texttt{Partition}$ compares $z_j$ with every other item in $Z_{ij}$. Thus, $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if the first element to be chosen as a pivot from $Z_{ij}$ is either $z_i$ or $z_j$. In the latter two cases, where one of $z_i$ or $z_j$ is chosen as a pivot, since the pivot is removed from future comparisons, it is never compared again with the other element.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: right\"> $\\blacksquare$ </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of this lemma, consider an input to quicksort of the number $1$ thorough $10$ in some arbitrary order. Suppose that the first pivot element is $7$. Then the first call to $\\texttt{Partition}$ separates the numbers into two sets: $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ and $\\{8, 9, 10\\}$. In the process, the pivot element $7$ is compared with all other elements, but no number from the first set (e.g., $2$) is or ever will be compared with any number from the second set (e.g., $9$). The values $7$ and $9$ are compared because $7$ is the first item from $Z_{7, 9}$ is $7$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next lemma gives the probability that two elements are compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Lemma 7.3*\n",
    "Consider an execution of the procedure $\\texttt{Randomized-Quicksort}$ on an array of $n$ distinct elements $z_1 < z_2 < \\cdots < z_n$. Given two arbitrary elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ where $i < j$, the probability that they are compared is $\\frac{2}{j - 1 + 1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Proof*** Let's look at the tree of recursive calls that $\\texttt{Randomized-Quicksort}$ makes, and consider the sets of elements provided as input to each call. Initially, the root set contains all the elements of $Z_{ij}$, since the root set contains every element in $A$. The elements belonging to $Z_{ij}$ all stay together for each recursive call of $\\texttt{Randomized-Quicksort}$ until $\\texttt{Partition}$ chooses some element $x \\in Z_{in}$ as a pivot. From that point on, the pivot $x$ appears in no subsequent input set. The first time that $\\texttt{Randomized-Select}$ chooses a pivot $x \\in Z_{ij}$ from a set containing all elements of $Z_{ij}$, each element in $Z_{ij}$ is equally likely to be $x$ because the pivot is chosen uniformly at random. Since $|Z_{ij}| = j - i + 1$, the probability is $\\frac{1}{j - 1 + 1}$ that any given element in $Z_{ij}$ is the first pivot chosen from $Z_{ij}$. Thus, by Lemma 7.2, we have\n",
