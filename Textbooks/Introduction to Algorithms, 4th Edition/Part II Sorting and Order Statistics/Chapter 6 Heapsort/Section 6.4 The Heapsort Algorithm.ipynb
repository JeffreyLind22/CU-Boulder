    "The heapsort algorithm, given by the procedure $\\texttt{Heapsort}$, starts by calling the $\\texttt{Build-Max-Heap}$ procedure to build a max-heap on the input array $A[1:n]$. Since the maximum element of the array is stored at the root $A[1]$, $\\texttt{Heapsort}$ can place it into its correct final position by exchanging it with $A[n]$. If the procedure then discards node $n$ from the heap - and it can do so by simply decrementing $A.\\textit{heap-size}$ - the children of the root remain max-heaps, but the new root element might violate the max-heap property. To restore the max-heap property, the procedure just calls $\\texttt{Max-Heapify}(A, 1)$, which leaves a max-heap in $A[1:n-1]$. The $\\texttt{Heapsort}$ procedure then repeats this process for the max-heap of size $n-1$ down to a heap of size $2$.\n",
