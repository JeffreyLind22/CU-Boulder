    "Its inputs are an array $A$ with the *heap-size* attribute and an index $i$ into the array. When it is called, $\\texttt{Max-Heapify}$ assumes that the binary trees rooted at $\\texttt{Left}(i)$ and $\\texttt{Right}(i)$ are max-heaps, but that $A[i]$ might be smaller than its children, thus violating the max-heap property. $\\texttt{Max-Heapify}$ lets the value at $A[i]$ \"float down\" in the max-heap so that the subtree rooted at index $i$ obeys the max-heap property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each recursive step determines the largest of the elements $A[i]$, $A[\\texttt{Left}(i)]$, and $A[\\texttt{Right}(i)]$ and stores the index of the largest element is *largest*. If $A[i]$ is largest, then the subtree rooted at node $i$ is already a max-heap and nothing else needs to be done. Otherwise, one of the two children contains the largest element. Positions $i$ and *largest* swap their contents, which causes node $i$ and its children to satisfy the max-heap property. The node indexed by *largest*, however, just had its value decreased, and thus the subtree rooted at *largest* might violate the max-heap property. Consequently, $\\texttt{Max-Heapify}$ calls itself recursively on that subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze $\\texttt{Max-Heapify}$, let $T(n)$ be the worst-case running time that the procedure takes on a subtree of at most $n$. For a tree rooted at a given node $i$, the running time is the $\\Theta(1)$ time to fix up the relationships among the elements $A[i]$, $A[\\texttt{Left}(i)]$, and $A[\\texttt{Right}(i)]$, plus the time to run $\\texttt{Max-Heapify}$ on a subtree rooted at one of the children of node $i$ (assuming that the recursive call occurs). The children's subtrees each have size at most $\\frac{2n}{3}$, and therefore we can describe the running time of $\\texttt{Max-Heapify}$ by the recurrence\n",
