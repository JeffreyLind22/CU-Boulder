    "### Definition: Input Size\n",
    "Input size is dependent on the problem being studied. For many problems, such as sorting problems or discrete Fourier transforms, the most natural measure is the number of items in the input. For many other problems, such as multiplying two integers, the best measure of input size is the total number of bits needed to represent the input in ordinary binary notation. In other cases, the input size requires more than just one number to represent."

    "### Definition: Running Time\n",
    "The running time of an algorithm on a particular input is the number of instructions and data accesses executed. How we account for these costs should be independent of any particular computer, but within the framework of the RAM model. For the moment, let's adopt the following view. A constant amount of time is required to execute each line of our pseudocode. One line might take more or less time than another line, but we'll assume that each execution of the $k$th line takes $c_k$ time, where $c_k$ is a constant."

    "For each $i = 2, 3, \\ldots, n$, let $t_i$ denote the number of times the **while** loop test in line 5 is executed for that value of $i$. When a **for** or **while** loop exits in the usual way - because the test in the loop header comes up false, the test is executed one time more than the loop body. Because comments are not executable statements, assume that they take no time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The running time of an algorithm is the sum of running times for each statement executed. A statement that takes $c_k$ steps to execute and executes $m$ times contributes $c_km$ to the total running time. We usually denote the running time of an algorithm on an input size of $n$ by $T\\left(n\\right)$. To compute $T\\left(n\\right)$, the running time of Insertion-Sort on an input of $n$ values, we sum the products of the *cost* and *times* columns, obtaining $T\\left(n\\right) = c_1n + c_2(n-1) + c_4(n-1) + c_5 \\sum_{i=2}^n _i + c_6 \\sum_{i=2}^n (t_i - 1) + c_7 \\sum_{i=2}^n (t_i - 1) + c_8 (n-1)$\n",

In this case, each time that line 5 executes, the value of *key* - the value originally in $A[i]$ - is already greater than or equal to all values in $A[1:i-1]$, so that the **while** loop of lines 5-7 always exits upon the first test in line 5.
