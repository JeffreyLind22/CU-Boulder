    "### Loop Invariants and the Correctness of Insertion Sort\n",
    "Consider an array $A$ that starts out with the sequence $\\langle 5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3 \\rangle$. The index $i$ represents the \"current card\" being inserted into the hand. At the beginning of each iteration of the **for** loop, which is indexed by $i$, the subarray (a contiguous portion of the array) consisting of elements $A[1:i-1]$ constitute the currently sorted hand, and the remaining subarray $A[i+1:n]$ corresponds to the pile of cards still on the table. In fact, elements $A[1:i-1]$ are the elements originally in positions $1$ through $i-1$, but now in sorted order. We state these properties of $A[1:i-1]$ formally as a loop invariant:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of each iteration of the for loop, the subarray $A[1:i-1]$ consists of the elements originally in $A[1:i-1]$, but in sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop invariants help us understand why an algorithm is correct. When you're using a loop invariant, you need to show three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:** It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintenance:** If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Termination:** The loop terminates, and when it terminates, the invariant - usually along with the reason that the loop terminated - gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how these properties hold for insertion sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:** We start by showing that the loop invariant holds before the first iteration, when $i=2$. The subarray $A[1:i-1]$ consists of just the single element $A[1]$, which is in fact the original element in $A[1]$. Moreover, this subarray is sorted since it only contains one element, which shows that the loop invariant holds before the first iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintenance:** Next, we tackle the second property: showing that each iteration maintains the loop invariant. Informally, the body of the **for** loop works by moving the values in $A[i-1]$, $A[i-2]$, $A[i-3]$, and so on by one position to the right until it finds the proper position for $A[i]$, at which points it inserts the value of $A[i]$. The subarray $A[1:i]$ then consists of the elements originally in $A[1:i]$, but now in sorted order. Incrementing $i$ for the next iteration of the **for** loop then preserves the loop invariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Termination:** Finally, we examine the loop termination. The loop variable $i$ starts at 2 and increases by 1 for each iteration. Once the value of $i$ exceeds $n$, the loop terminates. That is, the loop terminates once $i = n + 1$. Substituting $n+1$ for $i$ in the statement of the loop invariant yields that the subarray $A[1:n]$ consists of the elements originally in $A[1:n]$, but in sorted order. Hence, the algorithm is correct.\n"

    "**Maintenance:** At the beginning of the $i$th iteration, $\\text{sum} = A[1] + A[2] + \\ldots + A[i-1]$. Then, since the operation $\\text{sum} = \\text{sum} + A[i] = A[1] + A[2] + \\ldots + A[i-1] + A[i]$ is performed, for the $i+1$th iteration, *sum* is equal to the sum all the elements in $A[1:i]$, which is an equivalent statement to the loop invariant.\n",

    "**Termination:** Once the value of $i$ exceeds $n$, that is, $i = n + 1$, the loop terminates. Substituting this into the loop invariant statement yields that *sum* contains the sum of all elements in $A[1:n]$, and thus the procedure is correct."
